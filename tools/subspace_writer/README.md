# subspace writer
to get distributed sparse grid subspace size files for a scenario

## usage
call like a DisCoTec example executable, i.e.
```
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
mpiexec -np $nprocs ./subspace_writer $ctparam
```
with $nprocs the number of processes in one process group and $ctparam the combination scheme (that specifies the ctscheme json file to read).

If you want the sizes of a conjoint grid, you also need to specify the other scheme as
```
[subspace]
otherctscheme = ....json
```
in $ctparam.
