Welcome to GENE, a Vlasov code for gyrokinetic turbulence simulations.

For more detailed instructions type 'gmake doc' and open the GENE 
documentation /doc/gene.pdf (/doc/gene.ps) and tutorial slides
/doc/tutorial.pdf.

The impatient may follow the following steps:

1. Type: gmake or make in this directory

2. GENE compiles if a makefile for your machine is already found 
   in /makefiles (note: you might need to set the MACHINE environment
   variable by hand) - if not, open bin/new_machine.mk and set all 
   the required libraries and go to step 1

3. Type: ./newprob 

   This will create a "problem" subdirectory prob01 containing the 
   input file "parameters" and a link to the executable.
   If your system architecture has been detected automatically the
   directory will also contain submit script examples.

4. Enter the problem directory "prob01" 

5. Edit the "parameters" file, e.g. set the physical and numerical
   parameters, either by using the GENE launcher ../GENE-GUI.py or 
   your preferred editor.

6. Edit the batch system script and submit your job.
