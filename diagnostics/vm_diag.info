This is a readme file containing comments on the Gene Diag Tool VM creation using the SVN project file. IF YOU ARE NOT A GENE DEVELOPER, THIS FILE WILL NOT CONTAIN RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR YOU.

vm_diag.prj has been tested to work independently of the username when operated this way:

1. your Gene Diag Tool directory needs to be ~/gene11/diagnostics/

2. after modifying the Gene Diag Tool (using the newest SVN version as a base), open idlde; there, open project vm_diag.prj; in project/options, select project type: sav file; select project/build (choose OK in the dialog); this will create the sav file to be checked in in order to refresh the VM version

3. when exiting IDL, it may be necessary NOT to save the current project file; as of now, it is unclear whether changes to the file structure of the VM version require direct text-based editing of vm_diag_prj to preserve inter-user operability -- if problems are encountered or solutions are found, please contact mjpuesch at ipp mpg de

Note that this readme file is meant to be TEMPORARY. As soon as the aforementioned problems have been sorted out, it may be deleted; possibly, the documentation will require updating at that point.
