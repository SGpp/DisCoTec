## What is DisCoTec?

This project contains **DisCoTec**, a code for running the *dis*tributed sparse
grid *co*mbination *tec*hnique with MPI parallelization.
While it originates from the excellent
[SGpp project](https://github.com/SGpp/SGpp), all the parallelization makes it a
very different code, such that it has become its own project.

DisCoTec is designed as a framework that can run multiple instances of a
(black-box) grid-based solver implementation.
The most basic example we use is a [mass-conserving FDM/FVM constant advection
upwinding solver](/examples/distributed_advection/).
An example of a separate, coupled solver is [SeLaLib](/examples/selalib_distributed/).

### Sparse Grid Combination Technique with Time Stepping

The sparse grid combination technique (Griebel et al.
[1992](https://ins.uni-bonn.de/media/public/publication-media/griesiam.ps.gz),
Garcke [2013](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-31703-3_3),
Harding [2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-28262-6_4))
can be used to alleviate the curse of dimensionality encountered in
high-dimensional simulations.
Instead of using your solver on a single structured full grid (where every
dimension is finely resolved), you would use it on many different structured
full grids (each of them differently resolved).
We call these coarsely-resolved grids component grids.
Taken together, all component grids form a sparse grid approximation, which can
be explicitly obtained by a linear superposition of the individual grid
functions, with the so-called combination coefficients.

In this two-dimensional combination scheme, all combination coefficients are 1
and -1, respectively.
Figure originally published in (Pollinger [2024](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/14229)).

Between time steps, the grids exchange data through a multi-scale approach,
which is summarized as the "combination" step in DisCoTec.
Assuming a certain smoothness in the solution, this allows for a good
approximation of the finely-resolved function, while achieving drastic
reductions in compute and memory requirements.

### Parallelism in DisCoTec

The DisCoTec framework can work with existing MPI parallelized solver codes
operating on structured grids.
In addition to the parallelism provided by the solver, it adds the combination
technique's parallelism.
This is achieved through *process groups* (pgs):
`MPI_COMM_WORLD` is subdivided into equal-sized process groups
(and optionally, a manager rank).

The image describes the two ways of scaling up:
One can either increase the size or the number of process groups.
Figure originally published in (Pollinger [2024](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/14229)).

Combining the two ways of scaling up, DisCoTec's scalability was demonstrated on
several machines, with the experiments comprising up to 524288 cores:

![timings for advection solver step on HAWK at various
parallelizations](gfx/times-solver-on-hawk.svg)![timings for combination step on
HAWK at various parallelizations](gfx/times-combination-on-hawk.svg)

We see the timings (in seconds) for the advection solver step and the
combination step, respectively.
This weak scaling experiment used four OpenMP threads per rank, and starts with
one pg of four processes in the upper left corner.
The largest parallelization is 64 pgs of 2048 processes each.
Figure originally published in (Pollinger [2024](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/14229)).

Find a more detailed discussion in the [docs](https://discotec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallelism.html).

There are only few codes that allow weak scaling up to this problem size:
a size that uses most of the available main memory of the entire system.

## Installing

DisCoTec can be installed via spack, which handles all dependencies.
We recommend the `spack dev-build` workflow:

Clone both `spack` and `DisCoTec` to find or build the dependencies and then
compile DisCoTec:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:spack/spack.git  # use https if your ssh is not set up on github
./spack/bin/spack external find  # find already-installed packages
./spack/bin/spack compiler find  # find compilers present on system
./spack/bin/spack info discotec@main  # shows DisCoTec's variants
./spack/bin/spack spec discotec@main  # shows DisCoTec's dependency tree and which parts are already found

git clone git@github.com:SGpp/DisCoTec.git
cd DisCoTec
../spack/bin/spack dev-build -b install discotec@main
```

This will first build all dependencies, and then build DisCoTec inside the
cloned folder.
The executables are placed in the respective `example` and `test` folders.

## When to Use DisCoTec?

If you are using a structured grid solver and want to increase its
accuracy while not spending additional compute or memory resources on it,
DisCoTec may be a viable option.
The codes most likely in this situation are the ones that solve
high-dimensional problems and thus suffer the curse of dimensionality,
such as the 4-6D discretizations occurring in plasma physics or
computational quantum chemistry.
But if you have a "normal" 2-3D problem and find yourself
resource constrained, DisCoTec could be for you, too!
Use its multiscale benefits without worrying about any
multiscale yourself ðŸ˜Š

Why not try it [with your own solver](https://discotec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simple_tutorial.html)?

### What Numerical Advantage Can I Expect? 

Depends on your problem!
[Figure 3.6 here](http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/14229)
shows a first-order accurate 2D solver achieving
approximately second-order accuracy with the Combination Technique considering the total number of DOF.

## When Not to Use DisCoTec?

1. If memory and/or time constraints are not your limiting factor; you can easily achieve the numerical accuracy you need with your resources.
2. If your solver just does not fit the discretization constraints imposed by DisCoTec:
   - a rectilinear (or mapped to rectilinear) domain
   - structured rectilinear grids in your main data structure (=typically the unknown function), stored as a linearized array
   - numbers of values per dimension that can be chosen as various powers of two, and where any power of two is a coarsened version of the discretization achieved with the next power of two ("nested discretization").
   - if distributed-memory parallelism is used, it must be MPI
   - currently, DisCoTec does not support Discontinuous Galerkin schemes, 
     but it could be part of future versions (through Alpert multiwavelets).
