The files in this directory are sample input files from past 
(machine) benchmark exercises as well as proposed benchmarks 
for future studies.

Description:
1. parameters_multiscale_small  
   Multiscale simulation in local approximation
   high resolution in x and y (kx, ky)
2. parameters_stellarator
   Stellarator simulation in local approximation
   high resolution in z
3. parameters_multiscale_large
   same as 1) but even higher resolutions as they 
   are going to be required for realistic mass ratios
4. parameters_ITGTEM_global
   Example of a global run with full profile information
   high resolution in x and increased resolution in v and w

Strong scaling results for 1) and 2) can be found in

Note:
GENE does only accept "parameters" as input file.
The desired benchmark case has thus to be renamed.
