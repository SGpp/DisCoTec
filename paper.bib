  abstract = {High-dimensional grid-based simulations serve as both a tool and a challenge in researching various domains. The main challenge of these approaches is the well-known curse of dimensionality, amplified by the need for fine resolutions in highfidelity applications. The combination technique (CT) provides a straightforward way of performing such simulations while alleviating the curse of dimensionality. Recent work demonstrated the potential of the CT to join multiple systems simultaneously to perform a single high-dimensional simulation. This paper shows how to extend this to three or more systems and addresses some remaining challenges: load balancing on heterogeneous hardware; utilizing compression to maximize the communication bandwidth; efficient I/O management through hardware mapping; and improving memory utilization through algorithmic optimizations. Combining these contributions, we demonstrate the feasibility of the CT for extreme-scale Superfacility scenarios of 46 trillion DOF on two systems and 35 trillion DOF on three systems. Scenarios at these resolutions would be intractable with full-grid solvers ({$>$} 1,000 nonillion DOF each).},

  abstract = {The exact numerical simulation of plasma turbulence is one of the assets and challenges in fusion research. For grid-based solvers, sufficiently fine resolutions are often unattainable due to the curse of dimensionality. The sparse grid combination technique provides the means to alleviate the curse of dimensionality for kinetic simulations. However, the hierarchical representation for the combination step with the state-of-the-art hat functions suffers from poor conservation properties and numerical instability. The present work introduces two new variants of hierarchical multiscale basis functions for use with the combination technique: the biorthogonal and full weighting bases. The new basis functions conserve the total mass and are shown to significantly increase accuracy for a finite-volume solution of constant advection. Numerical analysis of the new basis functions reveals that their higher dual regularity does not only lead to conservation, but also yields an L2-stable basis for the combination technique. Accordingly, further numerical experiments applying the combination technique to a semi-Lagrangian Vlasov–Poisson solver in six dimensions show a stabilizing effect of the biorthogonal and full weighting bases on the simulations.},

  abstract = {Large HPC centers spend considerable time supporting software for thousands of users, but the complexity of HPC software is quickly outpacing the capabilities of existing software management tools. Scientific applications require specific versions of compilers, MPI, and other dependency libraries, so using a single, standard software stack is infeasible. However, managing many configurations is difficult because the configuration space is combinatorial in size. We introduce Spack, a tool used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to manage this complexity. Spack provides a novel, recursive specification syntax to invoke parametric builds of packages and dependencies. It allows any number of builds to coexist on the same system, and it ensures that installed packages can find their dependencies, regardless of the environment. We show through real-world use cases that Spack supports diverse and demanding applications, bringing order to HPC software chaos.},

In this context, dynamical low-rank approximations have emerged as a promising way to reduce the high computational cost imposed by such problems. However, a major disadvantage of this approach is that the physical structure of the underlying problem is not preserved. In this paper, we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm that conserves mass, momentum, and energy as well as the corresponding continuity equations. We also show how this approach can be combined with a conservative time and space discretization.},
